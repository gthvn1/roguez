# Download, build and run

## C
- I downloaded the stable release of **NCURSES** from [invisible-island.net](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/#download_ncurses).
- Then I built it and installed it in `~/opt/ncurses/`.
- I am able to build and run the hello world program from `main.c` using: `make && ./hello`.

## Zig

- Run the same example using Zig! ðŸŽ‰
- Use the installed library. On Debian it is located at `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.6.4`.
- Next: draw a maze
